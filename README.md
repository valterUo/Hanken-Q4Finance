# Hanken Hackathon Autumn 2023

## Quantum computing for finance

The anomaly detection implementation originates from [PennyLane tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_univariate_qvr/) and the related research paper [Quantum variational rewinding for time series anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16438.pdf).

The generative model was implemented during the Hackathon following the paper [A quantum generative model for multi-dimensional time series using Hamiltonian learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06150.pdf). 

Next steps:
- Both of the algorithms share similar elements. Maybe one advantage would be to train a single model for both use cases.
- Encoding graph structure to the diagonal Hamiltonian
- Comparing models to the classical algorithms
- Does the generative model work as a predictor?
